# Shiny-Surface-Temperature-Dashboard
A monitoring dashboard for trends in global surface temperature. 
Using gridded data and known data analysis techniques, we will make an interactive dashboard that will be used for climate outreach.
The techniques used involve fitting a changepoint model to each grid of data, revealing whether a specific lat/lon grid underwent a 'surge' in surface temp.
The data used was gathered from Berkeley Earth following a time period of (1850-2023)
